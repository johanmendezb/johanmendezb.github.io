                    <h4>PROFILE</h4>
                    <p class="profile-text-fullstack">Product-minded Full Stack Developer with a strong frontend foundation and 10+ years delivering digital products across fintech, e-commerce, logistics, telecommunications, tourism, and propTech. I build things that ship. My core strength is frontend development — creating maintainable, accessible, and performant interfaces — while I'm comfortable working across the full stack, architecting backend systems and AI-assisted workflows to deliver end-to-end solutions.</p>
                    <p class="profile-text-fullstack">I leverage GenAI tools ethically and strategically, accelerating development cycles while maintaining code quality. While my expertise is strongest on the frontend, I know my way around backend APIs, databases, and infrastructure, enabling me to work independently across the entire technology stack.</p>
                    <p class="profile-text-frontend" style="display: none;">Product-minded Frontend Developer with 10+ years delivering digital products across fintech, e-commerce, logistics, telecommunications, tourism, and propTech. I build things that ship. My expertise is in frontend development — creating maintainable, accessible, and performant interfaces that solve real user problems.</p>
                    <p class="profile-text-frontend" style="display: none;">I leverage GenAI tools ethically and strategically, accelerating development cycles while maintaining code quality. I work closely with backend teams and understand API integrations, but my core strength is crafting exceptional user experiences through thoughtful frontend architecture and implementation.</p>
                    <p class="">Working as a core team member in early-stage startups shaped how I approach problems: with architectural clarity, cross-functional collaboration, and a bias toward shipping. I've made critical technical decisions under pressure, collaborated closely with product and design teams, and learned that the best code is the code that solves real user problems.</p>
                    <p class="">What I bring: technical depth with a product lens and a process-driven mindset. I care as much about how teams build as what they build — establishing standards, improving workflows, and creating the conditions for consistent, high-quality delivery. Whether defining system architecture, mentoring teams, or streamlining development practices — I focus on sustainable results that create real value.</p>
